'Slime Launcher,' is a 1.14 mod that adds an item to the game which launches the player into the sky. It also adds Slime Boots which compliment the launcher well (stops fall damage & bounce the player). 


Slime Launcher was made in Fabric, which is a 1.14 alternative to Forge. It should work on most 1.14 snapshots but it will also be updated for the official versions as they are released.
